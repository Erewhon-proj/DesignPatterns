# DesignPatterns
Basic implementation of Software Engineering Design Patterns from the University of Catania.

## General info
This is the list of design patterns covered in the 2024 Software Engineering course at the University of Catania. 
The goal was to implement them in a very basic way to understand their general functionality, enhancing the study with the materials provided by the professor.

Some design patterns have been implemented in two ways:
- The **CLASSIC** approach, where the class and interface names follow the standard names commonly used in UML diagrams
- An **alternative approach** to illustrate how they could be applied in real scenarios.

**Note**: all examples focus exclusively on simple print instructions without calculations, to keep the code accessible for a first introduction.
